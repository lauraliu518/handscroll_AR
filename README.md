# Ming Dynasty Hand Scroll AR Experience

This project is an interactive augmented reality (AR) application designed to enhance the experience of viewing a Ming Dynasty hand scroll. It uses image targets to recognize the scroll and employs A-Frame to superimpose clickable objects, providing an immersive and educational experience. This project is part of a technical and interactive component for a tactile Museum Studies and Computer Science interdisciplinary project.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes image targets to recognize specific sections of the hand scroll.
- **A-Frame Integration**: Leverages A-Frame for rendering 3D models and interactive elements in AR.
- **Interactive Hotspots**: Clickable hotspots are placed around 3D models to provide additional information about artifacts.
- **AR Model Experience**: Users can experience AR models of objects of interest, enhancing their understanding and engagement.
- **Vue.js Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with Vue.js to display information and control interactions.

## Technical Details

- **HTML Structure**: The project consists of `head.html` and `body.html` files. The `head.html` includes necessary meta tags and script imports, while `body.html` contains the main AR scene and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: The `app.js` file is the main entry point, handling the initialization of components and managing interactions. It registers A-Frame components for gestures and hotspot interactions.
- **Assets**: Models and images are stored in the `assets` directory, providing visual elements for the AR experience.

## Usage

- Point your device's camera at the hand scroll to trigger the AR experience.
- Interact with hotspots to learn more about each artifact.
- Use touch gestures to rotate and explore 3D models.
